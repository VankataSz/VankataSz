/*
This is a simple Java 2d array game from the SoftUni educational program.

The game starts with 0 collected hazelnuts. Your goal is to collect 3 of them.
You get as input the size of the field, which will be always a square shape.
After that, you will receive the directions in which the squirrel can move – "left", "right", "down", and "up" in a sequence, each value separated by a comma and a space (", "). 
On the next rows, you will receive the field.

Possible characters in the field:
s - represents the squirrel's position.
h – represents a hazelnut. 
* – the asterisk represents an empty position.
t – represents a trap.

The squirrel starts from the s - position.
If the squirrel steps on a hazelnut, you have to increase them by 1. The position should be marked with an asterisk (*).
If the squirrel collects all 3 hazelnuts, the game ends.
Asterisk (*) does nothing, so nothing happens if the squirrel steps on it.
If it steps on a trap, the game ends.
If the squirrel moves out of the field, the game ends.

After all commands you will have 4 possible results:
You win if the squirrel collects 3 of the hazelnuts.
The squirrel collects less than 3 hazelnuts.
The squirrel steps on a trap.
The squirrel moves out of the field.

Input
On the first line, you will receive the length of the field – an integer number in the range [3, 5].
On the second line, you will receive the commands to move the squirrel – an array of strings separated by ", ".
In the next N lines, you will receive the values for every row.

Output
On the first line:
If the squirrel goes out of the field - "The squirrel is out of the field.".
If the squirrel steps on a trap - "Unfortunately, the squirrel stepped on a trap...".
If the squirrel hasn’t collected all hazelnuts - "There are more hazelnuts to collect.".
If the squirrel has collected all hazelnuts - "Good job! You have collected all hazelnuts!".
On the second line, print the number of collected hazelnuts - "Hazelnuts collected: {hazelnutsCount}"

Constraints
The size of the field will be between [3,5].
There could be one or no trap on the field.
There will always be 3 hazelnuts on the field.

Example Input/Output:
